To run OpenGL code with the Utah Teapot in MinGW-w64, you'll need to set up the necessary libraries and compile your program correctly. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. Install Required Libraries
   You need:

  GLFW (for window/context creation)

  GLEW (for OpenGL extensions)

  GLM (for math operations)

  FreeGLUT (optional, if using glutWireTeapot)

Install via MSYS2 (Recommended)
  Open MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit terminal and run:

  bash

  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-glfw mingw-w64-x86_64-glew mingw-w64-x86_64-glm mingw-w64-x86_64-freeglut
